# Youtube Data Project
The YouTube data project will look at analytics from YouTube videos uploaded to the HirePhD channel and determine best practices

## About
This repo contains code to analyze video data including metrics on views, the timing of views, interactions with videos, the influence of title on views (if applicable), and subscriber count following uploading videos. Additionally, we are interested in YouTube subscribers in relation to other platform followers (i.e. LinkedIn), and analytics will reflect this.
